xyz123
======

Converts RPG Maker's xyz image format to and from gifs.
**Note:** xyz123 is currently being redesigned and will not work as expected.
See TODO.

TODO
----

- Scrap bmp and ezflate files in favor of a gif library and zlib's utility
functions

- Write/rewrite comments

- Write a proper readme

Notes
-----

The name "xyz123" pokes fun at the genericness of the name of the format it
works with. Mind you, I probably couldn't come up with anything better.
