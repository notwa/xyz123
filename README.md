xyz123
======

Converts RPG Maker's xyz image format to BMPs.

TODO
----

- Refactor
- Take a bath (asserts, TODOs and FIXMEs)
- Write/rewrite comments
- Add BMP to xyz conversion
- Write a proper readme
- Complete list implementation

Notes
-----

The name "xyz123" pokes fun at the genericness of the name of the
format it works with - not like I could come up with anything better.
